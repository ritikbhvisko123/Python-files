#     "John: Absolutely, Adam! Communication skills are super important. First off, active listening is key. It’s not just about hearing the words but really understanding what the other person is trying to say.",
#    "Adam: That makes sense. How do you practice active listening?",
#    "John: One way is to focus fully on the speaker. That means putting away distractions like your phone or computer. Also, show that you’re listening through nodding or brief verbal acknowledgments.",
#     "Adam: Got it. And what about speaking clearly? I sometimes feel like I’m not getting my point across.",
#    "John: Clarity is crucial. Try to be concise and organized in your thoughts. It helps to structure what you want to say before you say it. Think of it like giving a mini-presentation.",
#   "Adam: That’s a good idea. Any advice on handling misunderstandings or disagreements?",
#    "John: Definitely. When a misunderstanding arises, stay calm and avoid jumping to conclusions. Ask clarifying questions and paraphrase what you’ve heard to ensure you’ve understood correctly.",
#   "Adam: Paraphrasing sounds useful. How do you approach disagreements?",
#    "John: Approach them with a mindset of collaboration, not confrontation. Focus on finding common ground and understanding the other person’s perspective. It’s more about solving the problem together than winning the argument.",
#    "Adam: I like that approach. Any final tips for improving communication in everyday situations?",
#   "John: Practice empathy. Try to put yourself in the other person’s shoes. Also, be aware of non-verbal cues, like body language and tone of voice. They can often convey as much as, or even more than, words.",
#   "Adam: Thanks, John. This is really helpful. I’ll start practicing these techniques and see how it goes.",
#   "John: No problem, Adam! Let me know how it works out. Good communication is a skill you can keep developing, so just keep at it!"""
